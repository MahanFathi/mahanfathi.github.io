* Intro
iLQR is an algorithm for trajectory optimization of nonlinear systems. It is actually quite hard
and tricky to implement it and by overlooking certain subtle things your well written code compiles
to a garbage. I advice taking a look at these great resources:

* Problem Setting
** Initialization and Notation

iLQR is firstly initialized with some dynamically feasible trajectory -- this could be merely
a roll-out of dynamics with zero control inputs, however, good initialization makes a difference
in the performance of the algorithm.

Here $n$ denotes the the number of steps remaining in the optimization, i.e. the optimization horizon.
So the next state after $x_n^*$ is $x_{n-1}^*$, by taking action $u_n^*$. The first state, $x_N^*$ is always
given by the problem settings. Also note that $(x_n^*, u_n^*)$ trajectory is a valid sequence, in that they
come from direct execution of actions and collection of states, on the model.


** Optimization Objective and Optimization Steps

The ultimate goal is to solve for the following trajectory optimization problem:

\begin{equation}
\min_{u_n ... u_1} \quad J_0(x_0) + \sum_{i=N}^{1} {g(x_i, u_i)} \\
\textrm{s.t.} \quad  x_{i-1} = f(x_i, u_i) \\
\quad  x_{N} = x_{start}
\end{equation}

$J_i^*(x)$ is the optimal cost-to-go for the remaining $i$ steps. The final cost-to-go, i.e. $J_0$ is given by the
problem setting and $J_0(x) = J_0^*(x)$, since there are no actions left to "optimize." The above-mentioned optimization
problem can be solved using many tools, including dynamic programming, e.g. value iteration etc, which solve the
following at each step:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:dp}
\min_{u_n} \quad J_{n-1}^*(f(x_n, u_n)) + g(x_n, u_n)
\end{equation}

However, solving for an arbitrary optimization problem at each step is computationally costly and unmanageable.
The thing about LQR that makes it so popular is that it makes dynamic programming recursion painless, by applying
the same analytical update at each step. This update is valid for a system with linear transition model and linear-quadratic
step-cost:

\begin{equation*}
x_{i-1} = c + A x_i + B u_i \\
g(x, u) = x^T Q x + q x + u^T R u + r u
\end{equation*}

Eventually, deploying LQ simplifications in equation (\ref{eq:dp}) yields:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:lqr_step}
\min_{u_n} \quad    (x_{n-1}^T V_{n-1} x_{n-1} + v_{n-1} x_{n-1}) +
                    (x_n^T Q x_n + q x_n) +
                    (u_n^T R u_n + r u_n) \\
\text{where:} \quad x_{n-1} = c + A x_n + B u_n
\end{equation}

It is assumed, correctly, that the optimal cost to go maintains an LQ shape throughout the optimization --
we also need to remember to make sure of that. By setting the gradient of $u_n$ to zero we can solve for
the optimal control input:

\begin{equation}
  \nabla_u [...] = 2 (c + A x + B u)^T V B + v B + 2 u^T R + r = 0 \\
  \implies \nabla_u^T [...] = 2 B^T V A x + (2 B^T V B + 2 R) u + 2 B^T V c + B^T v^T + r^T = 0
\end{equation}

So the control input is feedback-ish function of $x_n$:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:feedback}
  u_n = -(2 B^T V_{n-1} B + 2 R)^{-1} 2 B^T V_{n-1} A x_n + -(2 B^T V_{n-1} B + 2 R)^{-1} (B^T v^T + 2 B^T V c + r^T) \\
  u_n = K_n x_n + k_n
\end{equation}

By substituting equation (\ref{eq:feedback}) into (\ref{eq:lqr_step}) we can get J_n^*, which is going to be
in an LQ form, with a constant part which is not going to affect out lives in any way:

\begin{equation}
J_n^*(x) = x^T V_n x + v_n x + const\\
V_n = (A + B K_n)^T V_{n-1} (A + B K_n) + Q + K^T R K \\
v_n = 2 (k_n^T B^T + c^T) V_{n-1} (A + B K_n) + v_{n-1} (A + B K_n) + q + 2 k_n^T R K_n
\end{equation}

One minor thing we have to bear in mind is that, during the algebraic steps of we assume $V = (V + V^T) / 2$
or in other words, $V$ is symmetric.


* Nonlinearities

The problem however is, that neither a linear model nor a linear-quadratic step-cost function is associated with
most of interesting problems. To deal with this, the idea is to solve each optimization step for the vicinity of
a valid $(x_n, u_n, x_{n-1})$ tuple and try to improve the resulted trajectory each iteration at a time.


** Linearization of Dynamics

To be able to work with linear dynamics, the equations of motion, i.e. $x_{n-1}^* = f(x_n^*, u_n^*)$ need to
be approximated by a first-order Taylor expansion:

\begin{equation}
  x_{n-1} \approx x_{n-1}^* + A (x_n - x_n^*) + B (u_n - u_n^*)
\end{equation}

Subtracting $x_n^*$ yields:

\begin{equation}
  x_{n-1} - x_n^* \approx (x_{n-1}^* - x_n^*) + A (x_n - x_n^*) + B (u_n - u_n^*)
\end{equation}

By reparametrizing $x$ and $u$ respectively to $x - x_n^*$ and $u - u_n^*$, an affine system is reached:

\begin{equation}
  \zeta_{n-1} \approx (x_{n-1}^* - x_n^*) + A \zeta_n + B \nu_n \\
  \text{where:} \quad \zeta_m = x_m - x_n^*, \nu_m = u_m - u_n^*
\end{equation}

The $(x_{n-1}^* - x_n^*)$ term is merely a constant, e.g. $c$, and the affine system could be further simplified into:

\begin{equation*}
  \zeta_{n-1} \approx c + A \zeta_n + B \nu_n \\
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation}
  \implies z_{n-1}
  =
    \begin{bmatrix}
      \zeta_{n-1} \\
      1
    \end{bmatrix}
  =
    \begin{bmatrix}
      A & c \\
      0 & 1
    \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix}
      \zeta_n \\
      1
    \end{bmatrix}
  +
    \begin{bmatrix}
      B \\
      0
    \end{bmatrix}
    \nu_n
  =
  A^\prime z_n + B^\prime \nu_n
\end{equation}

\begin{equation*}
  z_{n-1} = A^\prime z_n + B^\prime \nu_n
\end{equation*}

However, the optimal solution for a single LQR step is already calculated [[*Optimization Objective and Optimization Steps][here]] and we don't need this last step.


** Differentiation of $\overrightarrow{F} = M \overrightarrow{a}$

To get the $A$ and $B$ matrices we need to differentiate the dynamics of equations. Adhering to MuJoCo notation,
$\overrightarrow{q}$, $\overrightarrow{q_{vel}}$, and $\overrightarrow{q_{acc}}$ respectively denote the joint positions,
velocities, and accelerations. The following equation describes the evolution of the state by Euler integration over a
timestemp:

\begin{equation}
    \begin{bmatrix}
      q_{n-1} \\
      qvel_{n-1}
    \end{bmatrix}
  =
    \begin{bmatrix}
      q_{n} \\
      qvel_{n}
    \end{bmatrix}
  +
    \begin{bmatrix}
      q_{n} \\
      qvel_{n}
    \end{bmatrix}
  * \Delta t
\end{equation}

Differentiation in MuJoCo, for now, is possible only through finite difference. To see how this is exactly carried out,
an official code sample can be found [[http://www.mujoco.org/book/source/derivative.cpp][here]]. After finding the primitive gradients, i.e. $\frac{\partial qacc}{\partial q}$,
$\frac{\partial qacc}{\partial qvel}$, and $\frac{\partial qacc}{\partial ctrl}$ you can construct the $A$ and $B$ matrices:

\begin{equation}
  A_{2nv, 2nv} =
    \begin{bmatrix}
      I_{nv, nv} & I_{nv, nv} * \Delta t \\
      \frac{\partial qacc}{\partial q} * \Delta t &
      I_{nv, nv} + \frac{\partial qacc}{\partial qvel} * \Delta t
    \end{bmatrix}
  ,
  B_{2nv, nu} =
    \begin{bmatrix}
      0_{nv, nu} \\
      \frac{\partial qacc}{\partial ctrl} * \Delta t
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

** Approximation of Cost

For the cost function $g$ we can follow the same drill, with the only difference that this time we are going to calculate
the Hessian too, or .. don't we? Note that we now ought to work with $z$ and $\nu$ instead of $x$ and $u$, which are only
an offset apart. Assuming that $g(x, u)$ function is implemented and we have access to its gradients with respect to $x$
and $u$ -- maybe via finite difference method or auto-differentiation, the gradients with respect to $z$ and $\nu$ are also
quite easy to reach:

\begin{equation}
  \frac{\partial g}{\partial z} =
    \begin{bmatrix}
      \frac{\partial g}{\partial x} \\
      0
    \end{bmatrix}
, \quad
  \frac{\partial g}{\partial \nu} = \frac{\partial g}{\partial u}
  \\
\end{equation}

To get the Hessians, we also don't going to bother us too much and we simply use the Jacobian approximation, i.e.
$H \approx J^T J$. Find a descent explanation [[https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2349026/why-is-the-approximation-of-hessian-jtj-reasonable][here]].

\begin{equation}
  \frac{\partial^2 g}{\partial z^2} \approx (\frac{\partial g}{\partial z})^T (\frac{\partial g}{\partial z}) \\
  \frac{\partial^2 g}{\partial \nu^2} \approx (\frac{\partial g}{\partial \nu})^T (\frac{\partial g}{\partial \nu})
\end{equation}

We also don't need to worry about $V$ and $v$, since differentiation zeros out the unwanted terms.
