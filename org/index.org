| [[./resources/profile_picture.jpg]] | I will be starting my master studies at Mila in Computer Science under supervision of Prof. Pierre-Luc Bacon. I received my B.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering at Sharif University of Technology. Leveraging Machine Learning and Optimization to endow robots with an extensive repertoire of skills, and fusing ideas from classical control theory with recent advances in A.I. appeal to me more than anything. To this end, I seek to conduct my research on synthesis of complex motions via model-based optimization and reinforcement learning in general for generation of natural-looking character animation. |
